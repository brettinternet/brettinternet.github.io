find that this hobby has become an excellent way to prototype and try new
technologies out.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="demo">Demo&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve set up a
&lt;a href="https://github.com/brettinternet/docker-compose-hosted-demo">simple demo to host an application&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Docker compose offers a very simple way to run and maintain self-hosted homelab.
As demonstrated here, tooling available makes automation and setup very easy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This demo hosts a simple Elixir notebook application called Livebook. I work in
an Elixir shop where Livebook is a local favorite. Livebook is a similar to
Python&amp;rsquo;s Jupyter except it&amp;rsquo;s built with Elixir and has real-time syncing between
clients because it&amp;rsquo;s built on the Phoenix framework&amp;rsquo;s library
&lt;a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/Phoenix.LiveView.html">LiveView&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This demo is for a single-node homelab using docker-compose to orchestrate a
Cloudflared tunnel connection, a Traefik reverse proxy and the Livebook app.
Cloudflare DNS is automated with CNAME creation from Traefik routes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s no port forwarding required.&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The phony make targets below are used to simplify each step. Look at the
&lt;a href="./Makefile">Makefile&lt;/a> to see what each one does.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, initialize the config file and terraform project.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>make setup
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This creates a &lt;code>.env&lt;/code> file which you should edit with your own secrets.
&lt;code>CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN&lt;/code> needs Zone.DNS and Account.Cloudflare Tunnel write
permissions for the domain in use. Use an API token, not an API key. The value
for &lt;code>CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_TOKEN&lt;/code> will come later.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Then, create the Cloudflared tunnel. You&amp;rsquo;ll need Terraform, unless you create it
from the &lt;a href="https://one.dash.cloudflare.com/">Cloudflare Zero Trust dashboard&lt;/a>.
Note, using the dashboard setup, point the tunnel endpoint to
&lt;code>http://traefik:80&lt;/code> as the cloudflared image sees the host within the docker
network.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>make terraform
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This plans and applies the terraform tunnel configuration. It creates a CNAME
record tunnel.example.com that points to the Cloudflared tunnel URL.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Find the &lt;code>tunnel_token&lt;/code> value in the terraform output file
&lt;code>./tunnel/terraform.tfstate&lt;/code> and add it as the value of
&lt;code>CLOUDFLARE_TUNNEL_TOKEN&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="run">Run&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Start the docker compose.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;">&lt;code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh">&lt;span style="display:flex;">&lt;span>make start
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>This runs &lt;code>docker-compose --compatibility up&lt;/code>. The compatibility flag appears to

&lt;p>Alexandra has become somewhat of a Martin Luther of science. Except her
&lt;em>Ninety-five Theses&lt;/em> is instead a database of 64 million academic papers in PDF.
Her work makes science more accessible to the laity, instead of a submission to
the interpretation and approval of academics from high-status institutions. My
own Bachelor of Science makes me nervous about the implications of lay folk
making decisions based on studies perused without understanding rigorous
philosophies of science. However, this is an unavoidable aspect already being
carried out by the shallow community of anti-science, FDA-approved pill pushers
and social influencers with their online degrees and beauty blogs. But imagine a
different scene of coffee shop discussions of fruit fly sleep cycles or dinner
table deliberation over neuronal action potential.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Paywalls and walled gardens for publications with insurmountable price tags make
learning an exclusive, invite-only process for elite institutions. The effects
of Reverend Luther&amp;rsquo;s translations of the bible to the German vernacular had
tremendous impact on both religious &lt;em>and&lt;/em> cultural contexts. With Sci-Hub making
scientific studies more widely available, I wonder if these academic papers
could receive the same widespread scrutiny that open source code receives from
the software community. Even rigorous disciplines receive contributions from
amateur enthusiasts, like the hobbyist who recently
&lt;a href="https://skyriddles.wordpress.com/2018/01/21/nasas-long-dead-image-satellite-is-alive/">found NASA&amp;rsquo;s lost satellite&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I am convinced that this is not primarily an economic issue but a moral one.
While we&amp;rsquo;re bombarded with an endless stream of media in this digital era (like
a
&lt;a href="http://nautil.us/issue/52/the-hive/modern-media-is-a-dos-attack-on-your-free-will">DoS attack on our attention&lt;/a>),
what effect would open discussions of empirical sources have on the quality of
our media consumption, and even the advancement of our society? This is all a
bit idealistic, but imagine this: a new generation of young scientists with the
democratization of evidence-based persuasion. Taxpayers should have access to
the research they paid for. Publishers hoard and monetize public research, but
hopefully not for long.&lt;/p></content></entry><entry><title>Building a Hackintosh</title><link rel="alternate" href="https://brett.cloud/hackintosh/"/><id>https://brett.cloud/hackintosh/</id><published>2017-04-23T00:00:00+0000</published><updated>2017-04-23T00:00:00+0000</updated><summary>Apple&amp;rsquo;s overpriced offering is moving away from modular, upgradable hardware.

Some recent unveils of the iMac, Mac Pro, and MacBook Pro failed to meet the
expectations of many professionals that demand improved specifications. Using
the more powerful hardware available with macOS can be the ultimate environment
for a developer—Unix coupled with strong machinery. For example, at the time of
writing this, I&amp;rsquo;m on my Kaby Lake build, but current Apple hardware doesn&amp;rsquo;t
offer the newest Intel generation. This is currently experimental in the
community, but more stable options do exist with Skylake hardware.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I first started developing on a MacBook. There are aspects of Apple&amp;rsquo;s laptops
that other hardware manufactures have not been able to match for me quite yet.
But as for a desktop where form factor, sleek aluminum design, and the
responsive trackpad are not concerns, then a Hackintosh is the way to go for
tabletop computing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Should you build a hackintosh? Probably not. It&amp;rsquo;s a breach of Apple&amp;rsquo;s macOS
Terms and Conditions and they
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psystar_Corporation">have sued companies&lt;/a> that
attempt to turn a profit. However, Apple has been kind and
&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/2ek35g/is_it_technically_illegal/">hasn&amp;rsquo;t litigated individuals&lt;/a>.
Building a Hackintosh involves a &lt;em>lot&lt;/em> of troubleshooting and tinkering. But if
you&amp;rsquo;re okay with all of this, then try it out! The first place to start is to
begin lurking in the community
(&lt;a href="https://reddit.com/r/hackintosh">/r/hackintosh&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve posted a

where I use the latest Kaby Lake Intel processor and the latest mobo. I use an

I read and reread
assignments, and I constantly evaluated my priorities to stay on task. I became
obsessed with managing my productivity. I&amp;rsquo;ve used feature-rich apps like
OmniFocus or Wunderlist and simpler tools like Apple Reminders.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For a while I used Evernote for note-taking, then I tried OneNote, Apple Notes
and even Google Keep. I left Evernote because they&amp;rsquo;d seemed to have lost their
way with gimmicky features. I liked that OneNote didn&amp;rsquo;t force-feed a premium
option and it was just as accessible as Evernote. Later, I thought that maybe
Apple Notes would be just enough for me, but I eventually found that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t
better for anything other than lists or using the touch draw feature.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now as a developer, I use markdown in my text editor. This process for
note-taking certainly isn&amp;rsquo;t novel – you&amp;rsquo;ll even find books on GitHub written
with markdown. Markdown offers the most formatting versatility, especially to
display code excerpts with syntax highlighting and quickly reference links,
create lists, and break notes out by sections. This is especially true since
&lt;a href="https://github.github.com/gfm/">GitHub&amp;rsquo;s flavoring&lt;/a> and small enhancements have
made markdown previewing so accessible. Even this blog is made using markdown.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="markdown">Markdown&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I love markdown. I like how widely support it is, and I like how clear markdown
format is to convey information. Markdown has become the ubiquitous plain text
format for the GitHub community. My own blog posts are written in markdown
(&lt;a href="https://github.com/brettinternet/brettinternet.github.io/">brettinternet.github.io&lt;/a>).
Composing markdown is a timeless method that isn&amp;rsquo;t married any third party tools
except a modern text editor (which isn&amp;rsquo;t going anywhere).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s true, this method isn&amp;rsquo;t perfect. I need separate tools for sketches and PDF
markups. But these mediums make up about 0.5% of all my notes. I just use my
NextCloud for storing files or Keybase for my public documents.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://githubengineering.com/a-formal-spec-for-github-markdown/">Some recent specification&lt;/a>
has been proposed to standardize Github&amp;rsquo;s flavor of markdown. One of my favorite
introductions to markdown can be found &lt;a href="http://commonmark.org/">here&lt;/a>.
Commonmark was put together by a few representatives of some major companies
that use markdown like GitHub, Reddit, and Stack Exchange. Some nonconforming
markdown features have added some very nice features such as task lists,
autolinking, diff and code block improvements.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="git">Git&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Right now I have a &lt;del>BitBucket&lt;/del> separate GitHub repo for my private notes and
another for my &lt;a href="https://github.com/brettinternet/public-notes">public notes&lt;/a>.
Eventually, I&amp;rsquo;d like to self-host my own GitLab within
&lt;a href="https://github.com/brettinternet/homelab">my homelab&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My commit messages are short, but I attempt to make them meaningful so I can see
my note history and refer back to find deleted excerpts. I also use
&lt;a href="https://github.com/brettinternet/dotfiles/blob/master/.aliases">aliases&lt;/a> for
git commands to make pushing to master very fast.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="desktop">Desktop&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I use Vim and VS Code. To me, taking notes in my editor environment is the best
possible scenario since I&amp;rsquo;m most comfortable with the shortcuts. VS Code offers
a markdown previewer out of the box with &lt;code>ctrl&lt;/code> + &lt;code>shift&lt;/code> + &lt;code>v&lt;/code>. Markdown&amp;rsquo;s
lifespan on desktop will exceed my own, so I&amp;rsquo;m no longer bound to an app&amp;rsquo;s
survival on a platform to access my notes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX">ShareX&lt;/a> is a good option for screenshots on
PC or &lt;a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Flameshot">Flameshot&lt;/a> or
&lt;a href="https://www.gimp.org/downloads/">GIMP&lt;/a> on Linux. I tend to think that a simple
bookmark is better than web clippings. EverNote certainly has the strongest
clipper, and I do like that OneNote&amp;rsquo;s web clipper is
&lt;a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/onenotedev/2016/08/31/the-web-clipper-goes-open-source/">open source&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="mobile">Mobile&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Before I found &lt;a href="https://workingcopyapp.com/">Working Copy&lt;/a>, a solid mobile git
solution for iOS was &lt;em>the&lt;/em> missing piece for keeping notes in a git repository.
I&amp;rsquo;m sure there are equally polished options on Android. With Working Copy you
can fetch repos for free, but you&amp;rsquo;ll have to pay to unlock push. The app is very
polished, so I think it&amp;rsquo;s worth it to support this developer. SSH keys are
supported, language highlighting and markdown and plain text previews. It&amp;rsquo;s an
excellent mobile option for iOS.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="save-menu">Save Menu&lt;/h3>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Everything not saved will be lost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>- &lt;em>Nintendo &amp;ldquo;Quit Screen&amp;rdquo; message&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Like an accessible save menu, I keep everything in markdown. I record docker
commands and obscure command-line arguments, JavaScript toy problems, or
directions to setup Postgres permissions. I also
&lt;a href="https://github.com/brettinternet/hugo-slides">create slides&lt;/a> with markdown.
I&amp;rsquo;ll only make a note of something if it&amp;rsquo;s easier to reference my notes than it
is to &lt;a href="/blog/becoming-a-professional-googler">Google search it&lt;/a>. I also take
notes to help out the students that I mentor. You can checkout my
&lt;a href="https://github.com/brettinternet/public-notes">public notes&lt;/a> on GitHub but you
can&amp;rsquo;t see my private ones 😉.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I use a combination of Apple Reminders and private GitHub issues with task lists
for short term personal tasks, and GitHub Projects to visualize Kanban project
and portfolio management. But for notes, I like good ol&amp;rsquo; fashioned git and
markdown. I use a private repository for my personal notes, and a separate repo
for my public notes. I believe this method is the strongest embrace of
trustworthy technology. Git and markdown are two timeless tools that are sure to
be around for a long time.&lt;/p>
