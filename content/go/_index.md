I encountered a [Hacker News comment](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44392307) that summarizes my perception of Go:

> I guess Google's years of experience led to the conclusion that, for software development to scale, a simple type system, GC, and wicked fast compilation speed are more important than raw runtime throughput and semantic correctness. Given the amount of networking and large - scale infrastructure software written in Go, I think they absolutely nailed it.

Go has become the "practical pragmatist" of modern languages. It's beloved for its simplicity but limited by deliberate design choices.

### What Works

Go excels as the reliable workhorse:

- Fast compilation prioritized over optimization
- Low barrier to entry with quick learning curve
- Networking and server development where it truly shines
- Simple type system that "just works"
- Comprehensive tooling for profiling and testing
- Strong concurrency with goroutines and channels

### The Core Limitations

Garbage Collection Reality

- "GC causes performance issues with large in-memory caches"
- Not optimized for large, long-lived object heaps
- Works best with short-lived objects
- Forces architectural compromises for performance-critical systems

Expressiveness Ceiling

- "Go has a very low barrier to entry, but also a relatively low ceiling"
- "The proliferation of codegen tools for Go is a testament of its limited expressive power"
- Limited type-level features compared to modern languages
- Repetitive error handling patterns

Design Philosophy Constraints

- "Go is the product of like 3 Googlers' tastes"
- Deliberately simple but sometimes oversimplified
- Lacks advanced type safety features
- Channel complexity despite being a core feature

### The Google Problem

Go optimizes for Google's specific use cases:

- Infrastructure and glue code
- Large teams with high turnover
- Prioritizes readability over expressiveness
- Fast compilation over runtime optimization

This creates friction for teams with different priorities or performance requirements.

### The Bottom Line

Go succeeds as a "good enough" language for many server-side tasks. Its compilation speed and simplicity make it excellent for rapid development and large teams. However, its deliberate limitations create frustration when projects outgrow its design constraints.

Go works best when:

- Building servers, networking, or glue code
- Fast iteration matters more than peak performance
- Team composition favors simplicity over expressiveness
- GC limitations align with your data access patterns

The language's greatest strength of extreme simplicity is also its primary limitation when requirements demand more sophisticated solutions.
