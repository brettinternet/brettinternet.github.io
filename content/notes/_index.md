In school, to keep up with my peers, I took meticulous notes. I read and reread
assignments, and I constantly evaluated my priorities to stay on task. I became
obsessed with managing my productivity. I've used feature-rich apps like
OmniFocus or Wunderlist and simpler tools like Apple Reminders.

For a while I used Evernote for note-taking, then I tried OneNote, Apple Notes
and even Google Keep. I left Evernote because they'd seemed to have lost their
way with gimmicky features. I liked that OneNote didn't force-feed a premium
option and it was just as accessible as Evernote. Later, I thought that maybe
Apple Notes would be just enough for me, but I eventually found that it wasn't
better for anything other than lists or using the touch draw feature.

Now as a developer, I use markdown in my text editor. This process for
note-taking certainly isn't novel â€“ you'll even find books on GitHub written
with markdown. Markdown offers the most formatting versatility, especially to
display code excerpts with syntax highlighting and quickly reference links,
create lists, and break notes out by sections. This is especially true since
[GitHub's flavoring](https://github.github.com/gfm/) and small enhancements have
made markdown previewing so accessible. Even this blog is made using markdown.

### Markdown

I love markdown. I like how widely supported it is, and I like how clear the markdown
format is for conveying information. Markdown has become the ubiquitous plain text
format for the GitHub community. My own blog posts are written in markdown
([brettinternet.github.io](https://github.com/brettinternet/brettinternet.github.io/)).
Composing markdown is a timeless method that isn't tied to any third-party tools
except a modern text editor (which isn't going anywhere).

It's true, this method isn't perfect. I need separate tools for sketches and PDF
markups. But these mediums make up about 0.5% of all my notes. I just use my
NextCloud for storing files or Keybase for my public documents.

GitHub has formalized their [CommonMark specification](https://github.github.com/gfm/)
to standardize GitHub's flavor of markdown.
Commonmark was put together by a few representatives of some major companies
that use markdown like GitHub, Reddit, and Stack Exchange. Some nonconforming
markdown features have added some very nice features such as task lists,
autolinking, diff and code block improvements.

### Git

I maintain a separate GitHub repository for my private notes and
another for my [public notes](https://github.com/brettinternet/public-notes).
Eventually, I'd like to self-host my own GitLab within
[my homelab](https://github.com/brettinternet/homelab).

My commit messages are short, but I attempt to make them meaningful so I can see
my note history and refer back to find deleted excerpts. I also use
[aliases](https://github.com/brettinternet/dotfiles/blob/master/.aliases) for
git commands to make pushing to master very fast.

### Desktop

I use Vim and VS Code for note-taking. Taking notes in my editor environment is ideal
since I'm most comfortable with the shortcuts. VS Code offers
a markdown previewer out of the box with `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `V`. Markdown's
lifespan on desktop will exceed my own, so I'm no longer bound to an app's
survival on a platform to access my notes.

[ShareX](https://github.com/ShareX/ShareX) is a good option for screenshots on
Windows, while [Flameshot](https://flameshot.org/) works well on Linux. I tend to think that a simple
bookmark is better than web clippings for most use cases.

### Mobile

Before I found [Working Copy](https://workingcopyapp.com/), a solid mobile git
solution for iOS was _the_ missing piece for keeping notes in a git repository.
There are equally good options on Android like [MGit](https://github.com/maks/MGit) or [Termux](https://termux.dev/). Working Copy
offers free repository cloning and viewing, with push capabilities available through in-app purchase. The app includes
SSH key support, syntax highlighting, and markdown preview. It's an
excellent mobile git client for iOS.

### Save Menu

Like an accessible save menu, I keep everything in markdown. I record Docker
commands and obscure command-line arguments, JavaScript problems, or
directions to set up Postgres permissions. I also
[create slides](https://github.com/brettinternet/slides) with markdown.
I'll only note something if it's easier to reference my notes than
search for it online. I also take
notes to help students I mentor.

I use a combination of Apple Reminders and private GitHub issues with task lists
for short term personal tasks, and GitHub Projects to visualize Kanban project
and portfolio management. But for notes, I like good ol' fashioned git and
markdown. I use a private repository for my personal notes, and a separate repo
for my public notes. I believe this method is the strongest embrace of
trustworthy technology. Git and markdown are two timeless tools that are sure to
be around for a long time.

I began experimenting with a much
simpler approach for tracking work-in-progress: `todo.txt` format.

As a parent with limited time, I've simplified to using
my phone's built-in notes app for quick capture. Sometimes convenience trumps
optimal workflow and the stage of life I'm in calls for it.
