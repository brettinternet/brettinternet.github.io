# Poach me

You may have been linked to this page as part of my recruitment funnel. If you
are _not_ a recruiter and you are a hiring manager, please see how to
[recruit me](/recruit). You may also [learn more about me personally](/about).

**If you are a recruiter**, use this method to explore my candidacy for your
position. We need to be candid about whether I would be a good fit. I'm
suspicious of canned messages and recruiters that waste time.

If you believe I'm the right candidate, then follow this process to get me on a
call with you.

## Step 1

Buy me lunch with a donation.
[Donate $20 here](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/brettinternet/20). A donation
should filter out spam and insincerity.

## Step 2

Email me at `poach@[this site's domain]` with details that I can review about
the open job position. Include something that will identify your PayPal
donation.

## Step 3

I guarantee you at least 7 minutes on a call. I'm respectful and honest. I
listen to your pitch.

## Step 4

I review the position and get back to you within 3 business days with a formal
response about the positions.

## Disclaimer

Due to the volume of recruiter messages I receive, I have developed this method
in order to avoid ghosting you. I do this to show professional respect and save
both of us time.
