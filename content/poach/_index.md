# Poach me

You may have been linked to this page as part of my recruitment funnel. If you
are _not_ a recruiter and you are a hiring manager, please see how to
[recruit me](/recruit).

**If you are a recruiter**, use this method to explore my candidacy for your
position. Let's be candid about what would make us a good fit.

## How to get me on a call with you

### Step 1

Buy me lunch with a donation.
[Donate $20 here](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/brettinternet/20). A donation
should filter out spam and insincerity.

### Step 2

Email me at `poach@[this site's domain]` with details that I can review about
the open job position. Include something that will identify your donation.

### Step 3

I guarantee you _at least_ 10 minutes on a call. I'm respectful and honest. I
listen to your pitch.

### Step 4

I review the position and get back to you within 3 business days with a formal
response about the positions.

## Disclaimer

I have developed this method in order to avoid ghosting you. I do this to show
professional respect and save both of us time.
