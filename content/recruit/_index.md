# Recruit me

Hi, let's be candid about what would make us a good fit.

### What you get

- I have been hard at work solving challenges with my
  [current employer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brettinternet/). I've been
  dedicated to solving realtime patch management in an interesting way and
  scaling our realtime connections to a million devices.
- I have an armory of proven techniques to collaborate really well remotely and
  [experience](/resume) mentoring, teaching, and uplifting others. I'm
  corrigible and I enjoy being on teams with people of different backgrounds,
  experiences, and viewpoints.
- I'm thrilled by what I do. You can tell by what my coworkers say about me, my
  commitment to the products I work on, and the effort I put into my career
  [development outside working hours](https://github.com/brettinternet) â€“ I even
  run [my own servers](/homelab) at home.

### What I'm looking for

**I value opportunities** to innovate and solve complex technical challenges
with performant software that's meaningful to customers. I like to write _Go_,
_TypeScript_, _Elixir_, _Python_ and _SQL_. And _YAML_ if I have to ðŸ™‚.

I am **only** open to remote work at this time.

I'm willing to discuss moonlighting additional
[contract or consulting](/consult) work.

As part of the recruitment process, I would like an opportunity to sit down with
the team (virtually or in-person) to answer questions and discuss the product
and engineering experience.

#### Think I might be a good fit?

Please share with me some details before we connect on a call:

- What can you share about the product's tech stack (e.g. front and backends,
  other services, legacy code)?
- How do the engineering and product teams look (e.g. headcount, experience,
  roles)? What does a Pull Request on the team look like?
- What problems are you trying to solve with your product?
