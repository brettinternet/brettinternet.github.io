# Recruit me

Hi, let's be candid about what would make us a good fit. I clearly spell a few
things out here in order to save both of us time. You can also
[learn more about me personally](/about).

You should know that I really enjoy my job. But, perhaps you have something that
I won't want to miss.

### What you get

- I've been hard at work
  [writing production code](https://github.com/brettinternet) for years now with
  an enterprise quality fit to solve problems at different scales and
  velocities. I've learned all kinds of technologies and I'm excited to continue
  to learn and solve problems.
- I have solid DevOps experience, and I even run
  [my own Kubernetes cluster](/homelab) at home.
- I have [experience](https://go.gardiner.cloud/resume) mentoring, teaching, and
  uplifting others.
- I'm thrilled by what I do. You can tell by what my coworkers say about me, my
  commitment to the products I work on, and the effort I put into side-projects.
- I'm corrigible. I believe it's important to find growth in any circumstance
  and to learn from everyone I work with.

### What I'm looking for

I'm open to working with most kinds of products. Given the current market, I'm
not open to products that rely solely on blockchain technologies.

As part of the recruitment process, I require an opportunity to sit down with
the team (virtually or in-person) to answer questions and discuss the product
and engineering experience.

I am only open to remote work at this time.

I'm willing to discuss moonlighting additional contract work.

If you still think I might be a good fit, then please share with me some details
before we connect on a call:

- What can you share about the product's tech stack (e.g. front and backends,
  other services, legacy code)?
- What do the engineering and product team look like (e.g. headcount,
  experience, roles)?
- What problems are you trying to solve with your product?
