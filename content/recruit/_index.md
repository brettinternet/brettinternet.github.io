title: Recruit me
description: Let's be candid about what would make us a good fit

Hi, let's be candid about what would make us a good fit. I spell a few things
out here in a very straightforward way in order to save us both time. You can
also [learn more about me personally](/about).

You should know that I really enjoy my job. But, perhaps you have something that
I won't want to miss.

### What you get

- I've been hard at work
  [writing production code](https://github.com/brettinternet) for years now with
  enterprise quality fit for teams of all kinds of experience. I've learned all
  kinds of tech and I'm excited to continue to learn and solve problems.
- I have devops experience, and I even run [my own Kubernetes cluster](/homelab)
  at home.
- I have [experience](https://go.gardiner.cloud/resume) mentoring, teaching, and
  uplifting others.
- I'm excited by what I do. You can tell by what my coworkers say about me, my
  commitment to the products I work on, and the effort I put into side-projects.
- I'm corrigible. I believe it's important to find growth in any circumstance
  and to learn from everyone I work with.

### What I'm looking for

I'm open to working with most kinds of products. Given the current market, I'm
not open to products that rely solely on blockchain technologies.

As part of the recruitment process, I require an opportunity to sit down with
the team in a casual setting to answer questions and discuss the product and
engineering experience.

I am only open to remote work at this time.

I'm always willing to discussing additional contract work, but not as full time
work.

If you still think I might be a good fit, then please share with me some details
before we connect on a call:

- What can you share with me about the product's tech stack (e.g. front and
  backends, other services, legacy code)?
- What do the engineering and product team look like (e.g. headcount,
  experience, roles)?
- What problems are you trying to solve with your product?
