I won't want to miss.

  [writing production code](https://github.com/brettinternet) for years now with
  an enterprise quality fit to solve problems at different scales and
  velocities. I work with all kinds of technologies and I'm excited to solve
  problems.

  [my current employer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brettinternet/) for quite
  some time, dedicated to solving realtime patch management in an interesting
  way.
- I have [experience](/resume.pdf) mentoring, teaching, and uplifting others.
- I'm thrilled by what I do. You can tell by what my coworkers say about me, my
  commitment to the products I work on, and the effort I put into my career
  development outside working hours.
- I have solid DevOps experience, and I even run [my own servers](/homelab) at
  home.
- I'm corrigible and I enjoy being on teams with people of different
  backgrounds, experiences, and viewpoints. I believe it's important to find
  growth in any circumstance and to learn from everyone I work with.

### What I'm looking for

**I value opportunities** to innovate and solve complex technical challenges so
I can grow and stretch myself. I seek to deliver performant software that's
meaningful to customers.

I'm open to working with most kinds of products. I like to write _Go_,
_TypeScript_, _Elixir_, _Python_ and _SQL_.

As part of the recruitment process, I would like an opportunity to sit down with
the team (virtually or in-person) to answer questions and discuss the product
and engineering experience.

I am **only** open to remote work at this time.

I'm willing to discuss moonlighting additional
[contract or consulting](/consult) work.

If you still think I might be a good fit, then please share with me some details
before we connect on a call:

- What can you share about the product's tech stack (e.g. front and backends,
  other services, legacy code)?
- What do the engineering and product team look like (e.g. headcount,
  experience, roles)? What does a Pull Request on the team look like?
- What problems are you trying to solve with your product?
