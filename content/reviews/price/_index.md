Price's town brothel is legalized under the facade of this so called "public
service".

Imagine hiring the county’s most atavistic hillbillies as gunslinging tax
collectors. The judicial’s romantic worship of the local prosecutor is apparent
when you find that every indulgence will be paid in full at this church of the
Wild West. We were victims of the ‘roid-raging roadster-adjudicators here in
podunk Price, UT.
