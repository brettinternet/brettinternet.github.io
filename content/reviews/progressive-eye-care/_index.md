Some business models are to swindle and bankrupt families.

The predatory practice of Progressive Eye Care begins by obscuring all costs to
avoid upfront disclosure about insurance coverage (despite our inquiries). They
ended up charging cash on the way out the door because their strategy is to prey
on patients by adding line items to an unrelated visits – these items were _not_
covered by insurance. Credit to them for a sense of humor, because in the end
these goofballs provided no assistance with our case.
